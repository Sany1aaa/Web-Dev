        <p id = "song">
        On the 23rd of November, under autumn's spell,<br>
A birthday tale unfolds, the joy we couldn't quell,<br>
Balloons and confetti, a festive array,<br>
For a special someone, on this memorable day.<br>

(Chorus)<br>
Happy birthday, under the November sky,<br>
Cake and laughter, as time passes by,<br>
In 2023, the celebration so grand,<br>
A birthday wish, as the candles stand.<br>
        </p>
