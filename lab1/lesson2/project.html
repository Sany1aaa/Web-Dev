        The word utopia was coined in 1516 from Ancient <strong>Greek </strong>by the Englishman Sir Thomas More for his Latin text Utopia. It literally translates as <em>“no place”</em>, coming from the Greek: <em>οὐ</em> (“not”) and τ<em>όπος</em> (“place”), and meant any non-existent society, when ‘described in considerable detail’.[4] However, in standard usage, the word's meaning has shifted and now usually describes a non-existent society that is intended to be viewed as considerably better than contemporary society
